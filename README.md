1. Intro, Terminology, Background
    - agents
2. Legal Domain Challenges
    - client intake

3. Different AI/ML Techniques
4. Current State and Opportunities for Improvement


Key problem: Existing LLM's are unreliable and not fully verifiable or transparent

Thesis: and even if they were fully reliable in terms of correct answers, they that wouldn't make them verifiably/transparently reliable. This verifiability and transparency is 

Language Reasoning Models trained using reinforcement learning show some improvements and applications, but still nowhere near as good as symbolic planners.
- keep target audience in mind, questions they would ask, pointing out gaps where other people can work on stuff

challenges:
1. 

potentially show how Language models perform with using Catala, either formalizing laws in catala, or using the catala to understand and reason about a circumstance.

what about other papers that talk about how language models understand the law, 

look at a paper, ask questions how they relate to language models,
- what does this paper do
- what does this paper not do


reading papers, takaways:
- LLMs are bad at reasoning and planning even when things aren't very complex.
- what about benchmarks on translating from natural language to CSP problems like in QuestBench? (this is similar to what was talked about with LLM-Modulo framework)
- can we formulate Legal reasoning problems as logical CSP or planning problem?
- can we use LLM-Modulo framework to elicit questions to ask to answer QuestBench questions?

Topics:
- Consistency analysis of contracts: ContractCheck
- Automatic execution of contracts: Symboleo
- Specification and Automatic Execution of statutory law: Catala
- Verification of higher-level properties of law: Catala

potential future projects
- translating to/from formal language
    - machine translation
    - llm-modulo framework
- llm reasoning in formal language
- case study using ContractCheck with miller thompson
